# Michael Jordan - Treasure Hunt 

## Application Description 
This treasure hunt application was a project done during my time at jumpstart @ LEARN Academy coding bootcamp. Jumpstart is a pre-requisite 3-day course that goes over the basics and fundamentals of building web application using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For this application, I decided to go with the basketball theme since it's my favorite sport. It contains a small treasure hunt board game, 3x3 table that is created from HTML and functionality with JavaScript written in a single function with a conditional statements.
